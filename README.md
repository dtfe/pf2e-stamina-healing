# pf2e-stamina-healing
 
This module aims to accomplish a single task. It allows overhealing to carry over to stamina.

This requires libwrapper and the stamina variant rule to be activated.

This is my first module and I am eager to hear from anyone who might have some suggestions to improve the code / add additional features.

**Wanted features:**
- Visual feedback. Normally healing shows a green "+x" popup whenever you receive healing. I haven't been able to figure out how to do so, but I want to add something similar, but in a different color for stamina which people can change in the settings.
- Apply heal modifiers. Currently modifiers to the token does not apply to the stamina healing. I could not figure out how to access that data.
